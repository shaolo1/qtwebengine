# qtwebengine

This fork is for the sole purpose of porting some of the example cpp code to python, specifically pyqt5.

An attempt was made to keep the structure of the code the same for easier comparison.

So far the only example ported is:
  simplebrowser - https://github.com/shaolo1/qtwebengine/tree/dev/examples/webenginewidgets/simplebrowser/pyqt5
